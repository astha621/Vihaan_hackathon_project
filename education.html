                  I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting
                  myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of

                Arjuna describes his moment of weakness right before the
                commencement of the great Kuru war, that is leading him to
                despair and depression. Krsna however, after patiently hearing
                Arjuna out, helps him shift perspective and see things in a
                newer and fresher light — a more holistic outlook.
              </p>

                Happiness and distress are destined for everybody! If you’re
                happy today, be assured that distress will follow, and if you’re
                under the weather today, then be assured that the sun will rise
                tomorrow. This world is a place of duality, and the dualities
                will come and go. We must learn to tolerate and eventually
                transcend, like Arjuna did! It is important that we’re taught
                the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita. It is most beautiful,
                revealing and enlightening. It takes away all pain, anxiety and
                fear! STRENGTH!

                Krsna wants us to stay in this world for whatever time is
                allotted to us and fight! Don’t give up! We must do our assigned
                duty! The body is temporary and so are the pains and pleasures
                that come along with it. Don’t be too attached to them. Don’t
                fall for the trap or illusion of comfort. Nothing is permanent
                in this world. Everything comes and goes like the seasons in a
                year …
              </p>
              <p>
                Krsna describes this world as duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam — temporary
                and filled with miseries, and so to harbour aspirations to enjoy
                this world and live comfortably forever, is really missing the
                point! When we falsely think that we shall never die, and that
                name, fame, money, power, etc. are the only sources of
                happiness, things can get a WHOLE LOT UNBEARABLE!

              <p>
                So as Krsna desires and other great spiritualists and devotees
                of the Lord confirm, we must learn about the soul and seek
                ourselves. It is very important — as knowledge of ourselves as
                spiritual beings sets the groundwork on which we can continue to
                develop spiritually, pursuing and reestablishing our lost
                connection with Krsna Himself, the Supersoul!
              </p>
              <p>
                <i
                  >"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogīs in
                  devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full
                  of miseries, because they have attained the highest
                  perfection."</i

                This highest perfection is pure bliss, or happiness in all its
                glory. It is what we constantly and ever-increasingly experience
                when we meet the Lord face-to-face. Isn’t this what we all seek?
                To be eternally, infinitely and ever-increasingly happy?

                This body is not yours! It is given to you for a reason. And
                everything that comes along with the body must be taken in
                stride and dealt with accordingly. When Krsna asks us to
                tolerate pains and pleasures, He wants us to transcend material
                reality, and be situated in the spirit.

                forest, Krsna reproved Arjuna, and incited him to use his
                abilities for the Lord’s pleasure and not his own. Arjuna’s body
                was not his own property, but an instrument of the Lord, who
                wanted to do great things through Arjuna!

              <p>
                A devotee of the Lord — a transcendentalist always sees
                reversals and misfortune in life as the blessings of the Lord.
                In fact, it is the special mercy of the Lord that all our
                so-called friends, society, attachments, wealth, etc. wither
                away. When advanced devotees find themselves at the threshold of
                great loss and sufferings, they rejoice, for they know it is the
                special mercy of the Lord. Devotees take reversals as a signal
                to strengthen their meditation on the Lord, and deepen their
                relationship with Him. No more worldly distractions!<br />
